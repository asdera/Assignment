# What it does
AssignME is a web application that revolves around optimizing the best date/time slot for a group of people. It takes into consideration your events and their level of importance. For our project we chose to focus on the educational industry and specifically targeting schools boards as a whole and how the student body will benefit from better organization in teachers' schedules. This platform can help students reduce stress and improve their mental health by eliminating conflicting assessment periods.

# How we built it
We built a website using Angular and FireBase, to display the webpage we used HTML and CSS within the Angular components to provide the web design. For our database we used Firestore. We used the Angular router to change URL based on the specified school-ID. This allowed us to have multiple schedules running at once for multiple users. We used observables and subscriptions to update our data in real time. Lastly, we added user authentication with Google Sign-In.

# Challenges we ran into
Often times the ideas we had were out of our programming knowledge
Many of our ideas were already implemented in the real world
At times our topic was fairly broad causing us to lose sight of our target audience
Trying to stick with simple ideas
Not having enough time to integrate all the desired features (Calendar API)
Not being able to get the Domain ready
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Tackling a prominent problem that we all deal with on a daily basis (high-school students)
